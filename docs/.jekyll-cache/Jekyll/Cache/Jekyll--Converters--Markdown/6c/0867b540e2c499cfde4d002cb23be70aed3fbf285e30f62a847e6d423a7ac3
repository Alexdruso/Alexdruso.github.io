I"¶<p><strong>Hello there</strong>, my name is <strong>Alessandro Sanvito</strong> and I am a COBOL devâ€¦nah, 
just <a href="https://i.redd.it/xjh798wltbz21.jpg">kidding</a>!</p>

<p>Currently I am a <strong>Data Science MSc</strong>. student pursuing a double degree at 
<a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/">Polimi</a> and <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH</a>, 
as a part of the <a href="https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/programmes/dsc/">EIT Digital Master program</a>.
My master focuses on distributed systems and efficient predictive algorithms, 
with a strong entrepreneurial mindset, as part of an Innovation&amp;entrepreneurship minor.</p>

<p>Before that, I was a <strong>Computer Engineering BSc</strong>. at Polimi, developing a strong technical 
background. Although the main focus of the degree was computer science, I spent some of my 
elective credits following courses on telecommunications and I liked them so much I am now 
to</p>
