**Hello there**, my name is **Alessandro Sanvito** and I am a software and AI engineer.

Currently, I am working as a **Software Engineer** at **Optiver** in Amsterdam, focusing on high‑performance, low latency C++ and Python code for the financial industry.

I recently completed my **AI Research Internship and Master Thesis** at **Mercedes-Benz** in Stuttgart, where I worked on 3D human avatars modeling from monocular videos in in-the-wild settings, utilizing generative neural models for computer vision under adverse weather conditions. My work there led to an ICCV publication.

I hold a double degree MSc. in ICT Innovation, Data Science, from [Polimi](https://www.polimi.it/en/) and [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en) as part of the [EIT Digital Master program](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/programmes/dsc/). My master’s program focused on distributed systems and efficient predictive algorithms, with a strong entrepreneurial mindset as part of an Innovation & Entrepreneurship minor.

Prior to that, I obtained my **BSc. in Engineering of Computing Systems** from Polimi, developing a strong technical background in computer science and telecommunications. I am also pursuing a license as a radio amateur, hoping to blend my interest in RF and optical communication with a data-driven approach.

Before my university studies, I was a **liceo classico** student, studying the classical world, learning ancient Greek and Latin, and honing my communication, critical thinking, and creativity skills.

In my spare time, I enjoy TV series, board games, and kickstarting too many projects to pursue and finish. I am also a blood donor at [AVIS](https://www.avis.it/) and a volunteer at [Tutto è Numero](https://circolomatematico.org/).
