I"$<p><strong>Hello there</strong>, my name is <strong>Alessandro Sanvito</strong> and I am a COBOL dev…nah, 
just <a href="https://i.redd.it/xjh798wltbz21.jpg">kidding</a>!</p>

<p>Currently, I am a <strong>Data Science MSc.</strong> student pursuing a double degree at 
<a href="https://www.polimi.it/en/">Polimi</a> and <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH</a>, 
as a part of the <a href="https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/programmes/dsc/">EIT Digital Master program</a>.
My master focuses on distributed systems and efficient predictive algorithms, 
with a strong entrepreneurial mindset, as part of an Innovation&amp;entrepreneurship minor.</p>

<p>Before that, I was a <strong>Computer Engineering BSc.</strong> student at Polimi and, as a result, I developed 
a strong technical background. Although the main focus of the degree was computer science, 
I spent some of my elective credits following <strong>telecommunications courses</strong> and I liked them so 
much I am now to get a licence as a radio amateur. I hope one day to blend my interest in RF and 
optical communication with a data-driven approach.</p>

<p>Before that, I was a <strong>liceo classico</strong> student, studying the classical world (I know ancient
greek and latin, for what it’s worth) and, most of all, learning valuable communication, 
critical thinking and creativity skills in a stimulating environment.</p>

<p>In my spare time I am just a nerd enjoying tv series, board games and kickstarting too many 
projects to pursue and finish. I am also a blood donor at <a href="https://www.avis.it/">AVIS</a> and 
a volunteer at <a href="https://www.tuttoenumero.circolomatematico.it/">Tutto è Numero</a>.</p>
