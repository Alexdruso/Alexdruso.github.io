Dear Sir or Madam,

My name is Alessandro Sanvito, and I am currently an EIT Digital MSc. student in Data Science at Politecnico di Milano and KTH. I am writing for an opportunity to take part in the Data Science Academy.

I believe a complementary work-oriented education is fundamental to a successful career. Therefore I would love to join the program, as I think it would help me to further develop my practical skills in the field in a meaningful way and to get a relevant insight into the companies involved. 

On the other hand, I think my profile would be a perfect match for the Academy, being my education path oriented towards data science and entrepreneurship.

In conclusion, I hope to get the opportunity to be a part of the Data Science Academy. Thank you for taking the time to review my application. Please contact me if you have any questions for me. I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

Alessandro Sanvito
