**Hello there**, my name is **Alessandro Sanvito** and I am a COBOL dev...nah, 
just [kidding](https://i.redd.it/xjh798wltbz21.jpg)!

Currently, I am a **Data Science MSc.** student pursuing a double degree at 
[Polimi](https://www.polimi.it/en/) and [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en), 
as a part of the [EIT Digital Master program](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/programmes/dsc/).
My master focuses on distributed systems and efficient predictive algorithms, 
with a strong entrepreneurial mindset, as part of an Innovation&entrepreneurship minor.

Before that, I was a **Computer Engineering BSc.** student at Polimi and, as a result, I developed 
a strong technical background. Although the main focus of the degree was computer science, 
I spent some of my elective credits to deepen my knowledge in the **telecommunications field** and 
I liked it so much I am now to get a licence as a radio amateur. 
I hope one day to blend my interest in RF and optical communication with a data-driven approach.
 
Before that, I was a **liceo classico** student, studying the classical world (I know ancient
greek and latin, for what it's worth) and, most of all, learning valuable communication, 
critical thinking and creativity skills in a stimulating environment.

In my spare time I am just a nerd enjoying tv series, board games and kickstarting too many 
projects to pursue and finish. I am also a blood donor at [AVIS](https://www.avis.it/) and 
a volunteer at [Tutto Ã¨ Numero](https://https://circolomatematico.org/).
