I'm **Alessandro Sanvito**, a Quantitative Developer at **Optiver** in Amsterdam, where I specialize in building high-performance trading systems for systematic options trading. My work combines advanced quantitative models with low-latency engineering to develop robust, scalable trading infrastructure.

## Current Focus

At **Optiver**, I'm part of a systematic options trading desk, where I:
- Design and implement high-performance trading systems in C++ and Python
- Develop and optimize quantitative models for options pricing and risk management
- Build robust infrastructure for real-time market data processing
- Create tools for automated trading strategies and risk monitoring
- Collaborate with traders and researchers to implement new trading ideas

## Technical Expertise

My technical background spans several key areas:

### Quantitative Development
- High-performance computing and low-latency systems
- Options pricing models and risk management
- Market microstructure and order book analysis
- Statistical arbitrage and algorithmic trading
- Real-time data processing and analysis

### Software Engineering
- C++ and Python for high-performance applications
- Distributed systems and parallel computing
- System architecture and optimization
- Testing and validation frameworks
- Continuous integration and deployment

### Research & Innovation
My recent work at **Mercedes-Benz** in Stuttgart focused on AI research, specifically:
- 3D human avatar modeling from monocular videos
- Computer vision under adverse conditions
- Published research at **ICCV** on generative neural models
- Experience with deep learning and computer vision

## Education & Background

I hold a **MSc. in ICT Innovation, Data Science** through a double-degree program between [Polimi](https://www.polimi.it/en/) and [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en), as part of the [EIT Digital Master program](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/programmes/dsc/). This program provided me with:
- Advanced knowledge in distributed systems and big data
- Expertise in machine learning and predictive algorithms
- Strong foundation in innovation and entrepreneurship
- Experience in international research environments

My journey began with a **BSc. in Engineering of Computing Systems** from Polimi, where I developed expertise in:
- Computer Science fundamentals
- Telecommunications and networking
- System architecture and design
- Software development methodologies

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not developing trading systems, I'm:
- Contributing to society as a blood donor at [AVIS](https://www.avis.it/)
- Supporting mathematical education as a volunteer at [Tutto Ã¨ Numero](https://circolomatematico.org/)
- Exploring new technologies and quantitative methods
- Enjoying TV series and board games
- Pursuing my interest in radio communications as an amateur radio enthusiast
